Unfortunately HHVM currently has [no Windows\nsupport](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/5460).\nThis package will have limited functionality on Windows and if you don't have HHVM installed.\n\nThis is what you need to do to get Hack language features working on your system:\n\n* Install HHVM.\n* Make sure `hh_client` is on your `$PATH`\n* Create a `.hhconfig` file in the root of your project (this can be empty).\n* Start your `.php` or `.hh` files with: `<?hh` at the top.\n\nVisit the [Hack page](http://hacklang.org/) for more detailed instructions.\n\n# Examples\n\nShows inline Hack errors:\n\n![Linter Errors](./images/HackLinterError.gif)\n\nTypeahead autocomplete:\n\n![Auto Complete](./images/HackAutocomplete.gif)\n\nType Hint with mouse hover:\n\n![Type Hint](./images/HackTypeHinting.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-hack/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebooknuclideapm/nuclide-hack","_id":"nuclide-hack@0.0.30","_shasum":"7b1e8594f8fc1470e181c08dd2f86821e2543456","_resolved":"file:../d-11578-7002-z39q9v/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11578-7002-z39q9v/package.tgz"}
